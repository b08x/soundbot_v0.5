Kickstarts and Anisble playbooks designed with minimalist intentions.
Kickstarts will a bare bones version of Fedora that uses the latest
stable version of the "Real Time" kernel.

Along with this, i3 window manager is installed for a low-footprint graphical
interface. The various Ansible playbooks will then install needed applications
for audio production.

## future designs

a playbook for;

a laptop; which will sometimes be used as a manager (of sessions, using i3) and other times
a personal pleasure device (using kde)

a robust host with a large processing and graphical capacity
mostly for studio work

a secondary processing host for live performances

In an attempt to gain some semblance of consistence,
I'm using [Non-Session Manager](http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Session%20Manager)
to manage part of the audio creation experience.

Also, some custom functions and aliases to ease the burden of memory.
Using bash-it

configurations are managed with dotfiles
